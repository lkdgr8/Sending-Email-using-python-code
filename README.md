# Sending-Email-using-python-code
the code will allow you to send emails or gmails without actually visiting the website 
method :
        I have used Gmail in my code
        if you are also using gmail then you will need to enable or turn on the 'low security app access' in your google account setting.
        becouse without this the gmail will not allow you to send mails using this code.
        
pros :
      easy and quick access to your email account.
      you can send as many emails as you want at a time.
      time saving. as you have easy access to edit email id(to whowm you want to send email), subject and content.
